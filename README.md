Using this docker package for XAMPP
https://hub.docker.com/r/tomsik68/xampp/

Dependencies

Install docker

Install Node.js

For now batch file will work with windows only, run the batch file.

Should start docker container that runns XAMPP on localhost port 

"To browse to your web page, visit this URL: http://localhost:41062/www And to open up the XAMPP interface: http://localhost:41062/"

http://localhost:41062/phpmyadmin/ is the link to modify the contents of the database

You should see a welcome to XAMPP screen once it is working properly!

Make sure you have the docker program open before trying to run the script. If docker is having issues starting, make sure you have your windows features set up properly. Search for "Turn Windows features on and off" and make sure "Containers" and "Hyber-V" is selected below. You should probably know all the other nuances on hwo to get virtualization to work by now :).
